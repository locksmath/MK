Master Keying
The purpose of this project is to provide information, training, and other help, on
the topic of master keying (specifically "split pin master keying") for locksmiths
and other security professionals.

LIABILITY
Reasonable efforts are made to ensure that the information provided herein is accurate.
However, no guarantee is made to the accuracy of the information. No warranty is given,
express or implied. Furthermore, master keying involves countless decisions, weighing
the advantages and disadvantages, in the context of the specific situation and the
system design requirements. For this reason, any information or advice herein must be
considered as general knowledge, which may or may not be relevant to a specific case.
All liability rests with the security professional who plans, designs, implements, and
maintains, the locks and keys of a master key system, or with the owner of the facility,
or with the end user. By continuing to view this information, you hereby agree to
indemnify and hold harmless the author and copyright holder, against any and all claims.

GOOD FAITH
It is assumed that any person viewing this information is doing so for legitimate and
legal purposes. Anyone who misuses this information for illegal or harmful activities
takes 100% of the blame for the consequences of those activities. There is a point of
view which says that security flaws should be kept secret, to prevent villains from
expoiting such flaws. This is known as "security through obscurity." We assert that it
is better to expose the flaws, so that steps can be taken to improve upon them, or (at
the very least) the system can be accurately evaluated, rather than providing a false
sense of security. The increase in security which is to be gained by free sharing of
information outweighs the risk of exploitation. A free and open discussion of security
issues, including flaws, must not be interpreted as encouraging any wrongdoing.

this project is certainly no exception. Anyone who views this information is free to
